Competitive Backlink Analysis with Python
This repository provides a Python-based solution for conducting competitive backlink analysis, enabling users to evaluate and compare backlink profiles across multiple domains.

Overview
Understanding the backlink landscape is crucial for SEO and digital marketing strategies. This project offers a comprehensive approach to analyze backlinks by:

Data Import & Cleaning: Streamlining the process of importing and cleaning backlink data from various sources.
Link Quality Assessment: Evaluating the quality of backlinks using metrics like Domain Rating (DR).
Link Volume Analysis: Analyzing the volume and growth of referring domains over time.
The methodology and code are inspired by the article "Competitor Backlink Analysis With Python [Complete Script]" by Andreas Voniatis.

Repository Contents
Competitive-Backlink-Analysis-Python.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete Python script for performing the backlink analysis.
comp-1.csv, comp-2.csv, comp-3.csv, my-domain.csv: Sample CSV files representing backlink data for different domains.
Getting Started
To utilize this script for your own analysis:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YashChowdhary34/competitive-backlink-analysis-python.git
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:

Analysis Features
Data Import & Cleaning:

Automates the import of multiple CSV files containing backlink data.
Cleans and preprocesses the data for analysis.
Link Quality Assessment:

Utilizes Domain Rating (DR) to assess the quality of backlinks.
Visualizes the distribution of DR across different domains using box plots.
Link Volume Analysis:

Computes the cumulative number of referring domains over time.
Generates line plots to illustrate the growth trajectory of backlinks for each domain.
Visualization Examples
The notebook includes visualizations such as:
